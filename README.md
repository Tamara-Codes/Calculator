My firt attempt at a simple calculator using HTML, CSS and JS. It is still far from working properly, but I wanted to put it on my github so that I can track changes and see the first draft compared to the final polished version! This took me about 5 hours to come up with. I haven't cheated, I've done it all by myself, the only joker I used was the official documentation. 

UPDATE: Another hour or so, and now it works. It's still far from good, but it kind of works. I added a TODO list not to forget what needs to be done.

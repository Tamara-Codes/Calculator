1. Round numbers to a certain decimal so they fit on the display
2. Make square function work for all numbers
3. Add a square root button and function
4. Make C button smaller
5. Display a snarky error message if the user tries to divide by 0… and don’t let it crash your calculator!
6. Your calculator should not evaluate more than a single pair of numbers at a time. Example: you press a number button (12), 
followed by an operator button (+), a second number button (7), and finally a second operator button (-). 
Your calculator should then do the following: first, evaluate the first pair of numbers (12 + 7), second, 
display the result of that calculation (19), and finally, use that result (19) as the first number in your new calculation,
along with the next operator (-).
7. Inpute only one decimal, now you can input as many as you like
8. If you click on an operator twice, it will get printed on the screen twice. Fix this.
